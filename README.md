# NextJS Auth Example

The example is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app with authentication using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).

It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to persist user accounts and support email sign in. Adding additional providers is as simple as commenting them out from `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`.
